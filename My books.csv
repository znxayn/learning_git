"Borden, Neil M.","Neil M. Borden","The 3D Angiographic Atlas of Neurovascular Anatomy and Pathology is the first atlas to present neurovascular information and images based on catheter 3D rotational angiographic studies. The images in this book are the culmination of work done by Neil M. Borden over several years using one of the first 3D neurovascular angiographic suites in the United States. With the aid of this revolutionary technology, Dr Borden has performed numerous diagnostic neurovascular angiographic studies as well as endovascular neurosurgical procedures. The spectacular 3D images he obtained are extensively labeled and juxtaposed with conventional 2D angiograms for orientation and comparison. Anatomical color drawings and concise descriptions of the major intracranial vascular territories further enhance understanding of the complex cerebral vasculature.","/Users/zxy/Calibre Library/Neil M.

"佩雷菲特","佩雷菲特","1793年英国使者马戛尔尼到访中国，这次出使在历史上最大的争论是：英国使者有没有向乾隆皇帝下跪磕头？…… 本书作者佩雷菲特从世界史的角度，将此次出使作为东方与西方的首次撞击来考察，于是，视野开阔了，可供思考的素材也就相应丰富起来。  
在作者眼中，这次英国人的出使实质意味着当时的“天下唯一的文明国家 ”面对“世界最强大的国家”…… 本书以详实的史实，有趣的细节，精彩的笔致，揭示中西文明巨大差异和冲突。  
二百年前，大英帝国从给乾隆祝寿为名向中国派出了马戛尔尼勋爵率领的庞大使团，英国此举意图同清政府谈判以改善两国的贸易，而中国方面由于文化背景与政治观念不同，认为英国里仰慕中华文明才遣使臣远涉重洋为皇上祝寿的，这场聋子之对话尚未开始就注定失败了。学术界争论已久的马戛尔尼觐见时是否下跪的问题并不单纯是一场礼仪之争，而是两种文明的撞击，具有深刻的象征意义。 法国作家阿兰·佩雷菲特先生就这一主题在1989年5月出版了《停滞的帝国》一书。该书一出版就进入畅销书行列，半年内就售出了20万册。

One can also discern in this volume, the importance of individuals in altering the course of human events and the, fate of nations, the wider concerns that preclude the massing by a world, power of its military strength in one direction, and many other facets of the, nation's recent military history it behooves all thoughtful Americans to, ponder., Colonel Schnabel's work is the third to appear in a planned 5-volume, history of the United States Army in the Korean War.

"沈志华","沈志华","《毛泽东、斯大林与朝鲜战争（珍藏本）》第一章讲述战后苏联的对外政策及其变化，重点在斯大林的对华政策和对朝政策，说明在保障苏联的远东战略利益的条件下，斯大林希望东北亚地区保持稳定状态，以维持根据雅尔塔协定所形成的国际体系和地缘结构。  第二章讲述中苏同盟建立特别是中苏同盟条约签订的过程，重点在于说明，中苏条约谈判的结果与以往人们的理解不同，主要不是毛泽东在莫斯科受到了冷遇和屈辱，而是斯大林被迫对中国做出了重大让步。这一让步，将导致苏联失去在太平洋的出海口和不冻港，使其在远东乃至亚洲的战略利益受到严重损害。正是在这种背景下，斯大林开始改变了对朝鲜半岛的政策。  第三章讲述朝鲜战争爆发的全过程，主要是斯大林对金日成想要用武力方式统一朝鲜半岛这一计划从反对到支持的转变过程。与第二版夹叙夹议的写法不同，这里的重点首先是对历史过程的叙述，而在最后一节集中讨论斯大林同意和支持金日成的决策动机。这一节完全是新写的，分析了以往研究者在这一问题上所作推断的逻辑漏洞或史实错误，并进一步论证了笔者自己的推断——斯大林同意发动朝鲜战争的主要目的在于维护和保证苏联在远东的战略利益。  第四章讲述中国出兵朝鲜的全过程，并根据不同的背景把这一过程分为六个阶段，分析了中国出兵的客观条件的变化，以及由于条件变化而导致的毛泽东所设定的行动目标的变化。同前一章一样，这里的重点也是历史叙事，而在最后一节集中讨论毛泽东决策出兵的动机。从条件和目标的变化可以看出，毛泽东的决策动机是多重的，并且有所变化，既有表面的，也有内在的，有的是临时处置，有的则贯穿始终。从总体上讲，中国出兵朝鲜是为了保持中苏同盟的有效政治态势，从而在根本上保障新政权的稳定和发展。这一节基本上也是新写的。  第五章讲述中苏同盟在战争中得到巩固和加强的方方面面，特别是在战略决策层面中国与朝鲜之间发生的诸多分歧和矛盾中，斯大林都支持了毛泽东，这说明毛泽东的出兵决策实现了其根本目标。因此，这个决策是必须的，也是正确的，虽然带有一定的风险。  余论讨论中国在1951年初拒绝联合国停火议案的问题。这是作者的最新研究成果，意在说明中国在朝鲜战争中的战略性失误并不在于出兵朝鲜的决策，而在于没有适时收兵，在最有利的条件下结束这场战争，并因此付出了本来可以避免的过于沉重的代价。","/Users/zxy/Calibre Library/Chen Zhi Hua/Mao Ze Dong , Si Da Lin Yu Zhao Xian Zhan Zheng (41)/cover.jpg","2020-11-02T13:08:54+08:00","epub, mobi, pdf","","41","mobi-asin:ec59cea6-82fa-4885-8fd8-30accb9a9e70","zho","Calibre Library","2015-02-12T00:00:00+08:00","blah.me","","","1.0","656852","历史","毛泽东、斯大林与朝鲜战争","毛泽东、斯大林与朝鲜战争","","fe46c455-b607-48af-a6f9-7279c2b18453"

In his preface he argues that despite weaknesses, theories are based on logic and provide structure for understanding fact. Of those who argue against him, Schumpeter asks a fundamental question: ""Is it really artificial to keep separate the phenomena incidental to running a firm and the phenomena incidental to creating a new one?"" In his answers, Schumpeter offers guidance to Third World politicians no less than First World businesspeople. In his substantial new introduction, John E.

"Taleb, Nassim Nicholas","Nassim Nicholas Taleb","Fooled by Randomness is a standalone book in Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s landmark Incerto series, an investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and decision-making in a world we don’t understand. The other books in the series are The Black Swan, Antifragile, Skin in the Game, and The Bed of Procrustes.Fooled by Randomness is the word-of-mouth sensation that will change the way you think about business and the world. Nassim Nicholas Taleb–veteran trader, renowned risk expert, polymathic scholar, erudite raconteur, and New York Times bestselling author of The Black Swan–has written a modern classic that turns on its head what we believe about luck and skill. This book is about luck–or more precisely, about how we perceive and deal with luck in life and business. Set against the backdrop of the most conspicuous forum in which luck is mistaken for skill–the world of trading–Fooled by Randomness provides captivating insight into one of the least understood factors in all our lives. Writing in an entertaining narrative style, the author tackles major intellectual issues related to the underestimation of the influence of happenstance on our lives. The book is populated with an array of characters, some of whom have grasped, in their own way, the significance of chance: the baseball legend Yogi Berra; the philosopher of knowledge Karl Popper; the ancient world’s wisest man, Solon; the modern financier George Soros; and the Greek voyager Odysseus. We also meet the fictional Nero, who seems to understand the role of randomness in his professional life but falls victim to his own superstitious foolishness. However, the most recognizable character of all remains unnamed–the lucky fool who happens to be in the right place at the right time–he embodies the “survival of the least fit.” Such individuals attract devoted followers who believe in their guru’s insights and methods. But no one can replicate what is obtained by chance. Are we capable of distinguishing the fortunate charlatan from the genuine visionary? Must we always try to uncover nonexistent messages in random events? It may be impossible to guard ourselves against the vagaries of the goddess Fortuna, but after reading Fooled by Randomness we can be a little better prepared.

"奈尔伯夫","奈尔伯夫","耶鲁大学教授奈尔伯夫和普林斯顿大学教授迪克西特的这本著作，用许多活生生的例子，向没有经济学基础的读者展示了博弈论策略思维的道理。试看一例： 　　 奈尔伯夫大学毕业的时候，在剑桥大学的正式舞会上参加轮盘赌游戏并且以700:300的大比数领先。眼看大奖在望，鬼使神差他却无视已经具有的后动优势，在最后一轮大意先行，结果功败垂成。事后他回忆那天酒喝多了，忘记了博弈论的教导：领先的时候要采取让对手先行的保守策略。这位博弈论的高才生，就这样输在原来处于第二位并且曾经求和建议分享奖励的女士手下（参见本书第1章）。 　　　　人生是一个永不停息的决策过程。从事什么样的工作，怎样打理一宗生意，该和谁结婚，怎样将孩子抚养成人，要不要竞争总裁的位置，都是这类决策的例子。你不是在一个真空的世界里做决定。相反，你身边全是和你一样的决策制定者。虽然冲突的成分很多，但是合作的因素也不少。本书将帮助你学会策略地思考，在人生博弈中扩大胜面。 　　　　本书以讲故事取胜。它的学术根源，是迪克西特教授在普林斯顿大学公共与国际事务学院开设的“策略博弈”课程。简而言之，这是关于了解对手打算如何战胜你，然后你战而胜之的艺术。怎样打赢一场网球，少数如何战胜多数，为什么要“喜爱”你最讨厌的对手等等，都在讨论之列。 　　　　这是一门新兴的策略科学，由一些简单的基本原理组成。不同背景和行业的读者掌握了这些原理，运筹帷幄取得胜利的本领就会上升一个层次。","/Users/zxy/Calibre Library/Nai Er Bo Fu/Ce Lue Si Wei (94)/cover.jpg","2020-11-02T13:10:22+08:00","epub, mobi, pdf","9787300043388","94","mobi-asin:7aa2872793e0b7e6e583e9fef812fd04a64da251-0-azw,isbn:9787300043388","zho","Calibre Library","2010-08-28T00:00:00+08:00","金读 kindle.im","","经济","6.0","21149703","经济管理","策略思维","策略思维","","15f69187-8c91-4841-857d-6d6f6e346938"
"莫博涅, W.钱·金;","W.钱·金; 莫博涅","译, （韩）W.钱·金，（美）莫博涅 著，吉宓译 企业为了寻求持久的、获利性的增长，往往与其对手针锋相对地竞争。它们为竞争优势而战，为市场份额而战，为实现差异化而战。 然而在目前过度拥挤的产业市场中，硬碰硬的竞争只能令企业陷入血腥的“红海”，即竞争激烈的已知市场空间中，并与对手争抢日益缩减的利润额。在这本书中，作者对你所熟知的一切战略成功的定律提出挑战。他们认为，流连于红海的竞争之中，将越来越难以创造未来的获利性增长。 作者基于对跨度达100多年、涉及30多个产业的150个战略行动的研究，提出：要赢得明天，企业不能靠与对手竞争，而是要开创“蓝海”，即蕴含庞大需求的新市场空间，以走上增长之路。这种被称为“价值创新”的战略行动能够为企业和买方都创造价值的飞跃，使企业彻底甩脱竞争对手，并将新的需求释放出来。 《蓝海战略》为企业甩脱竞争提供了一套系统性的方法。在这本颠覆传统战略思维的著作中，作者展示了一套经过实践证明的分析框架和工具，供企业成功地开创和夺取蓝海。通过对各种产业中为数众多的战略行动的分析，作者还提出了成功制定和执行蓝海战略的六项原则。这些原则告诉企业，该如何重建市场边界、注重全局、超越现有需求、遵循合理的战略顺序、克服组织障碍并把战略的执行建成战略的一部分。 本书自2005年2月由哈佛商学院出版社出版以来，在世界范围内引起了极大的反响，先后获得了“《华尔街日报》畅销书”、“全美畅销书”、“全球畅销书” 的称号，迄今为止已经被译成24种语言，打破了哈佛商学院出版社有史以来出售国际版权的记录。本书的作者还为本书开通了专门网站：www．blueoceanstrategy．com，如有需要，敬请查阅。","/Users/zxy/Calibre Library/W.Qian _Jin ; Mo Bo Nie/Lan Hai Zhan Lue (95)/cover.jpg","2020-11-02T13:10:24+08:00","mobi, pdf, txt","9787100048088","95","isbn:9787100048088","zho","Calibre Library","2011-03-19T00:00:00+08:00","子乌书简","","","1.0","419538","ZDC:JRGL","蓝海战略","蓝海战略","","64989339-6d3a-4562-91e4-36b5d9f6aa79"

"杰克·杜瓦尔, 彼得·阿克曼","彼得·阿克曼 杰克·杜瓦尔","For more than a century, from 1900 to 2006, campaigns of nonviolent resistance were more than twice as effective as their violent counterparts in achieving their stated goals. By attracting impressive support from citizens, whose activism takes the form of protests, boycotts, civil disobedience, and other forms of nonviolent noncooperation, these efforts help separate regimes from their main sources of power and produce remarkable results, even in Iran, Burma, the Philippines, and the Palestinian Territories.
Combining statistical analysis with case studies of specific countries and territories, Erica Chenoweth and Maria J. Stephan detail the factors enabling such campaigns to succeed and, sometimes, causing them to fail. They find that nonviolent resistance presents fewer obstacles to moral and physical involvement and commitment, and that higher levels of participation contribute to enhanced resilience, greater opportunities for tactical innovation and civic disruption (and therefore less incentive for a regime to maintain its status quo), and shifts in loyalty among opponents' erstwhile supporters, including members of the military establishment.
Chenoweth and Stephan conclude that successful nonviolent resistance ushers in more durable and internally peaceful democracies, which are less likely to regress into civil war. Presenting a rich, evidentiary argument, they originally and systematically compare violent and nonviolent outcomes in different historical periods and geographical contexts, debunking the myth that violence occurs because of structural and environmental factors and that it is necessary to achieve certain political goals. Instead, the authors discover, violent insurgency is rarely justifiable on strategic grounds.

"林达","林达","美国的面积和中国差不多。和大多数留学生及新移民一样,当我们一脚踏上这块广袤的陌生土地时,最初落脚点的选择是十分偶然的。我们落在了一个普通的地方,居住的环境平常而宁静。周围的美国人老老少少都在辛勤劳作,过着普通得不能再普通的生活。要想谋出一番好的光景,对他们也不是一件轻而易举的事情。  还来不及作任何思索,新移民所面临的生活压力就立即把我们投入了同样的辛勤劳作之中。这样,我们和周围的普通美国人之间,自然就有了共同谋生而产生的共同语言,也有了共同的经历,共同的喜怒哀乐。不少美国人还成了我们的好朋友。我们无形中发现,美国已经渐渐地从一堆抽象的概念中走出来,变成了脚下实实在在的土地,变成了一片片森林牧场,变成了一个一个美国人。  我们也有过被称之为“边缘人”的苦闷。我们显然不可能在进入这一块国土的同时,就在一瞬间也进入它的文化,而原来的文化背景又由于天长地远而渐显陌生。在实际生活中,两种截然不同的文化,会经常骤然直率地在我们面前相遇碰撞,一开始真有无所适从亦无可躲避的窘迫。然而,时间长了,我们开始对“边缘人”的处境逐渐坦然,甚至悟出了些什么。冷静下来,我们发现自己第一次能够这样坐在一个安静的地方,同时和两个文化保持一个不远也不近的距离,它们不仅开始有可能化为一片风景,而且第一次向我们呈现出前所未有的意义......","/Users/zxy/Calibre Library/Lin Da/Jin Ju Li Kan Mei Guo (Quan Ji ) (116)/cover.jpg","2020-11-02T13:23:29+08:00","epub, mobi, pdf, txt","","116","mobi-asin:9470fed0-e1ca-4a9e-a07e-66e6a57de13e","zho","Calibre Library","2011-03-29T00:00:00+08:00","epub掌上书苑","","","1.0","13053109","","近距离看美国(全集)","近距离看美国(全集)","","18b9860f-41ef-49d3-8a6e-15083e74bca1"

"Kirk, Russell","Russell Kirk","The Conservative Mind by Russell Kirk is arguably one of the greatest contributions to twentieth-century American Conservatism. Brilliant in every respect, from its conception to its choice of significant figures representing the history of intellectual conservatism, The Conservative Mind by Russell Kirk launched the modern American Conservative Movement. A must-read.
### Review
''[It] is inconceivable even to imagine, let alone hope for, a dominant conservative movement in America without [Kirk's] labor.'' --William F. Buckley, Jr.  

''Kirk is assured a place of prominence in the intellectual histories for helping to define the ethical basis of conservatism. He has tried to pull conservatism away from the utilitarian premises of liberalism, toward which conservatism often veers, toward a philosophy rooted in ethics and culture.'' -- *Wall Street Journal*
### About the Author
RUSSELL KIRK (1918-1994), historian of ideas, critic, essayist, editor, and novelist, was the author of thirty-two books. Among them are *The Roots of American Order, The Politics of Prudence, Enemies of the Permanent Things* , and six works of fiction.

"（美）埃里克·霍弗","（美）埃里克·霍弗","本书主要探讨群众运动的一些共有特征，重点是陷入狂热的乌合之众的人格。长期与下层民众打交道的生活经历使作者发现，积极投身群众运动的往往是一些失意者。他们认为自己的生活已无可救药地失败，渴望逃离自我寻求重生，将生命托付给某项神圣伟业让他们感觉不错，整齐划一的集体生活令个人的责任、恐惧、无能得以掩埋。运动的领导者则刻意培养参与者的罪恶感，号召自我牺牲以获救赎。自1951年出版后，本书即被视为社会科学领域的经典之作，短期内行销50万册以上，被译成10余种语言，是多所大学政治系的必读书。书中俯拾皆是充满智慧的思想火花与一针见血的比喻，风格酷似法国思想家蒙田与帕斯卡尔的随笔。至今，其佳言警句仍不断被引用、辑录。

"高文谦","高文谦","大陆禁上市!!!  长期以来,大陆官方出于政治的需要,一直讳言毛、周两人历史上恩恩怨怨的关系,文革时期更是禁忌,只准许毛泽东身边的几个工作人员出来撰写回忆文章。内容不是刻意遮掩毛不去参加周恩来追悼会的真正原因,就是大加渲染毛、周之间的所谓""深厚情谊""。         然而,结果是越描越黑,非但没有驱散人们心头的疑云,反而露出更大的破绽,因为这些记述和解释大都空洞牵强,有的甚至还自相矛盾。当然,更主要的还是因为周恩来的大半政治生涯一直笼罩在毛泽东的阴影之下,两人之间的关系剪不断理还乱,实在是太复杂了,绝非一两件事情的肯定或否定,就可以简单了断的。         应该说,毛泽东与周恩来两人的关系是中共党史和中国现代史中最令人感兴趣的话题之一,同时也是非常复杂微妙的地方。更重要的是,它是了解和把握晚年周恩来乃至其整个政治生涯的一把钥匙。目前海内外已经出版的研究毛、周两人的着作可谓汗牛充栋,难以计数,不过专门论及这个问题的却不多。而且即使涉及,也囿于各自的条件,大陆的难以跳出意识形态的桎梏,多有顾忌,欲言又止;而海外的则又难免给人以捕风捉影,隔靴搔痒之感。         正因为如此,本书的写作,相对而言有着得天独厚的条件。作者曾任中共中央文献研究室室务委员、周恩来生平研究小组组长,在大陆从事周恩来和文革史研究多年,出国前是大陆官方《周恩来年谱》、《周恩来传》和《毛泽东传》文革部分的执笔人。在大陆期间,作者曾在中共中央文献研究室的档案室里泡过十几年,看过大量历史文献档案,其中有许多是官方一直刻意遮掩而不见天日的核心档案。         另一方面,作者因同情和支持一九八九年由学生发起的爱国民主运动而在随后的清查中遭到整肃,目前寓居美国。与大陆学术界的同仁相比,享有写作上的自由,因此更有条件来写这样一本书,把周恩来这个依然在中共神坛上供奉的偶像,并且集中国传统文化与中共政治文化之大成的""党内大儒"",重新放回当年那段天翻地覆、狂热恐怖的年代中加以审视,在拂去历史的尘埃,剥掉涂抹的油彩,还给人们一个真实的周恩来。","/Users/zxy/Calibre Library/Gao Wen Qian/Wan Nian Zhou En Lai (144)/cover.jpg","2020-11-02T13:24:29+08:00","epub, mobi, pdf","9781586484156","144","isbn:9781586484156,mobi-asin:592f710c-989f-4af0-aacd-d945e66825ca","zho","Calibre Library","2012-01-18T00:00:00+08:00","epub掌上书苑","","","1.0","1644300","9781586484156, 历史","晚年周恩来","晚年周恩来","","9e3332c7-f240-49dd-8fe9-91bc41b70588"

"杨显惠","杨显惠","这部《定西孤儿院纪事》写的是“受苦人的绝境”，“夹边沟”是一批“右派分子”的流放地，“定西专区”是1960年左右的“大饥荒”在甘肃省内的一个“重灾区”。作者在忠实史料事实和当事人陈述事实的基础上，创作出一个个具有高度典型性和独特性的作品。完全是白描的手法，纪实性的语言，平实的语调，将一幕幕饥饿与死亡的惨烈情境撕裂在人们眼前。其实，对中国当代历史略有了解的人，都会对“右派”的遭遇和1960年“大饥荒”的灾难有一定的心理预期，为什么这些作品会一次次冲破人们的心理疆界？这是因为现实“绝境”的残酷性远远超出了人们的想像力，是作家虚构不出来的。这些以细节构成的个人的故事，使惨绝人寰的灾难变得具体可感，将之铭刻在我们的情感记忆中，不再容易被任何人用抽象的数字和话语所模糊遮盖，逼迫要继续活下去的人们不得不面对、反思。我们常说，文学的力量在于虚构，但在这样的真实面前，你会觉得一切虚构都失去了力量。这些年来，现实主义的创作手法不断被窄化、僵化、庸俗化，以至于它“写真实”的能力被许多人所质疑。杨显惠的作品再次向人们显示了，当代作家继续使用写实手法可能达到的表现力和穿透力，以及在有大量触目惊心的历史现实尚未被文学有力地表现、甚至被刻意遮蔽的当下环境中，这种手法的不可替代性。
(子乌注：嗯，为啥豆瓣不能收录这本书呢【搜索ISBN，然后在豆瓣添加】？各种好奇啊……要知道，亚马逊、当当都还在卖呢~~)

毛澤東在中國近代轉型史中，原只是個轉型中期的民族領袖。他個人的個性、見識、修養、訓練和時代，都只能鑄造他做個轉型高潮中的秦始皇，而不能做個完成轉型的漢武帝。這就叫做形勢比人強。毛澤東自視為天生聖哲，其實他和你我一樣，也只是個渺小的脊椎動物，並不能扭轉他們唯物主義者曲不離口的所謂「客觀實在」啊！他是時勢所造的英雄；但是他這個蓋世英雄卻未能創造時勢。夫復何言？

"譯, 姜哲煥 / 皮耶．李古樂 著，鐘玉玨","姜哲煥 / 皮耶．李古樂 著，鐘玉玨 譯","2000年首先以法文出版，
成為揭露北韓集中營生活最知名的脫北者回憶錄
南北韓分裂後，姜哲煥的祖父母放棄在日本豐衣足食的生活，義無反顧地遷回朝鮮報效祖國。九歲那年，受祖父犯「最重的叛國罪」牽連，姜哲煥一家旋即遭當局以政治犯家屬的名義，押解至北韓最大、監禁幾萬名政治犯的「耀德集中營」。
十年勞動改造，姜哲煥最深刻的體悟竟是：「人有作惡的無限潛能。」
在耀德，姜哲煥忍受恥辱、毒打、饑餓，以及無止盡的苦力勞動。求生的本能讓他性格丕變，學會了耍詐、偷竊、陽奉陰違，失去對他人憐憫與同情的能力。集中營卑劣的生活，逼著適應不良的囚犯自尋短路，姜哲煥的父親與四叔就因熬不過低潮，試圖結伴上吊。至於祖母，身為社會主義的虔誠信徒，轉變也最為劇烈。耀德不符人道精神的罪行，破除了她對金氏父子的迷思，看清北韓根本不是「社會主義的人間天堂」，反而更像由希特勒主宰的世界。
幸運獲釋後幾年，姜哲煥因非法收聽南韓電臺廣播，二度面臨勞改威脅。走投無路，他決心逃離地獄的魔爪，抵達旅程終點「大韓民國」重獲自由的那一刻，姜哲煥忍不住流下喜悅的淚，亟欲將北韓同胞所受的苦難與壓迫公諸於世。殊不知國際社會乃至同為大韓民族的南韓人，對北韓當局和集中營內侵犯人權的惡行惡狀，似乎無動於衷，脫北者的懇求得不到任何迴響。
來到首爾不久後，姜哲煥與在人權組織任職的李古樂結識。李古樂深信北韓政權之所以能為所欲為，部分因北韓老百姓與外界完全隔離，部分則出於國際社會對北韓政權罪行的一無所知。他建議姜哲煥現身說法，揭露北韓人民在金氏父子高壓統治下的生活實況。2000年，姜哲煥的遭遇終於在西方世界曝光，就連時任美國總統的小布希也深受感動與啟發。2005年，小布希邀請姜哲煥到白宮討論北韓問題的解決之道，並在2010年出版的個人回憶錄中「Decision Points」表示：「在我的總統任期內，《平壤水族館》是對我影響最大的書之一。」
姜哲煥現定居南韓，為社團法人北韓戰略中心代表，同時也是《朝鮮日報》客座記者，並持續聲援關切北韓境內的人權侵害問題。
姜哲煥（1968年生）
脫北者。年少時曾被北韓當局關押於耀德集中營達十年。獲釋後幾年決定逃往中國，並輾轉抵達南韓。目前定居首爾，為社團法人北韓戰略中心代表，以及《朝鮮日報》客座記者。

That’s where the future lies, and that’s what this book shows you how to do. Today’s web service technologies have lost sight of the simplicity that made the Web successful. This book explains how to put the “Web” back into web services with REST, the architectural style that drives the Web.

"[美] 凯文·凯利","[美] 凯文·凯利","《失控》，全名为《失控：机器、社会与经济的新生物学》（Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social  Systems, and the Economic World）。 2006年，《长尾》作者克里斯·安德森在亚马逊网站上这样评价该书：  “这可能是90年代最重要的一本书”，并且是“少有的一年比一年卖得好的书”。“尽管书中的一些例子在十几年后可能有些过时，但（它们所表达的）信息却越来越成为真知灼见”。“在那时人们还无法想象博客和维基等大众智慧的突起，但凯利却分毫不差地预见到了。这可能是过去十年来最聪明的一本书。”  这是一部思考人类社会（或更一般意义上的复杂系统）进化的“大部头”著作，对于那些不惧于“头脑体操”的读者来说，必然会开卷有益。  《失控》成书于1994年，作者是《连线》杂志的创始主编凯文·凯利。这本书所记述的，是他对当时科技、社会和经济最前沿的一次漫游，以及借此所窥得的未来图景。","/Users/zxy/Calibre Library/[Mei ] Kai Wen _Kai Li/Shi Kong (233)/cover.jpg","2020-11-02T13:27:07+08:00","epub, mobi, pdf","","233","mobi-asin:033964bd-7739-4b41-bab6-f65310e0c51e","zho","Calibre Library","2015-01-30T01:39:43+08:00","blah.me","","","1.0","58123003","（美）库兹韦尔著.奇点临近.北京市：机械工业出版社, 2011.10.","失控","失控","","375a33ec-e388-4a18-996e-f621f27c6566"

Andy Puddicombe, a former Buddhist monk, the Voice of Headspace, and the UK’s foremost mindfulness expert, is on a mission: to get people to take 10 minutes out of their day to sit in the here and now.
Like his readers and students, Andy began his own meditation practice as a normal, busy person with everyday concerns, and he has since designed a program of mindfulness and guided meditation that fits neatly into a jam-packed daily routine―proving that just 10 minutes a day can make a world of difference.
Accessible and portable, *The Headspace Guide to Meditation and Mindfulness* offers simple but powerful meditation techniques that positively impact every area of physical and mental health: from productivity and focus, to stress and anxiety relief, sleep, weight-loss, personal relationships...the benefits are limitless. The result? More headspace, less stress. Andy brings this ancient practice into the modern world, tailor made for the most time starved among us.
**Switch off after work * Fall asleep at night * Feel less anxious, sad, or angry * Control your cravings * Find a healthy weight**
**

"Greenberg, Mark S.","Mark S. Greenberg","***The quintessential neurosurgical handbook for day-to-day practice!*** Now in an updated ninth edition, Handbook of Neurosurgery by Mark Greenberg is synonymous with the most classic neurosurgical handbook published to-date. It has enjoyed legendary status as the go-to manual for legions of neurosurgeons for more than a quarter century. The comprehensive and conveniently compact book brings together a wide range of clinical practice guidelines from disparate sources into an amazing one-stop resource. Renowned for its depth and breadth, the updated text with nearly 1,800 pages encompasses the entire spectrum of neurosurgery including anatomy, physiology, differential diagnosis, and current principles of nonsurgical and surgical management. The text covers a huge scope of inherited, developmental, and acquired neurological disorders impacting pediatric to geriatric patients. The easy-to-navigate print and electronic formats provide an intuitive foundation for studying the field of neurosurgery. **Key Features:** * Boxed summaries, key concepts, tables, practice guidelines, signs/symptoms, and ""booking the case"" highlight and clarify salient points * Thousands of well-organized cross references, index entries, and literature citations provide additional study sources * Significant revisions to the tumor section reflect a wealth of up-to-date information including treatments, guidelines, sources, and more * The addition of new figures enhances understanding of diseases
As with prior editions, this must-have daily reference book does a magnificent job making essential neurosurgical information, current trends, breakthrough research, and reviews readily accessible to all neurosurgeons and allied health practitioners. This book includes complimentary access to a digital copy on https://medone.thieme.com.

**Synopsis**
 ****
In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival.
*The Barnes & Noble Review*
 **
Sixteen-year-old Katniss is smart, athletic, and fast. She can take down a rabbit with a bow and arrow, hitting it straight through the eye. Will these skills be enough to survive the Hunger Games? 
Suzanne Collins, the author of the middle-grade fantasy series The Underland Chronicles begins anew, exploring a future landscape that will be familiar to devotees of science fiction's dystopic strain. In a nation called Panem, which occupies the landmass that is the present United States, a parasitical fascist Capitol dominates 12 conquered districts. There was a thirteenth district but it was obliterated during a rebellion. The totalitarian government keeps the subjected populations in line by threatened devastation, starvation, and brutality.
*The New York Times - John Green*
 **
brilliantly plotted and perfectly paced…a futuristic novel every bit as good and as allegorically rich as Scott Westerfeld's Uglies books…the considerable strength of the novel comes in Collins's convincingly detailed world-building and her memorably complex and fascinating heroine. In fact, by not calling attention to itself, the text disappears in the way a good font does: nothing stands between Katniss and the reader, between Panem and America. This makes for an exhilarating narrative and a future we can fear and believe in, but it also allows us to see the similarities between Katniss's world and ours.
**Biography**
 ****
Suzanne Collin's debut novel, Gregor the Overlander, the first book in Underland Chronicles, received wide praise both in the United States and abroad. All three titles in the series are available on audio from Listening Library. Also a writer for children's television, Suzanne lives with her family in Connecticut.

"Weir, Andy","Andy Weir","**A lone astronaut must save the earth from disaster in this incredible new science-based thriller from the #1** New York Times **bestselling author of** The Martian **.  
  
“A novel that would have delighted Robert A. Heinlein and Isaac Asimov.”—George R. R. Martin, author of **A Game of Thrones **  
  
“Weir’s finest work to date . . . the one book I read last year that I am certain I can recommend to anyone, no matter who, and know they’ll love it.”—Brandon Sanderson, author of the Stormlight Archive series**  
  
Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission—and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish.  
  
Except that right now, he doesn’t know that. He can’t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.  
  
All he knows is that he’s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he’s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.  
  
His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it’s up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery—and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.  
  
And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he’s got to do it all alone.  
  
Or does he?  
  
An irresistible interstellar adventure as only Andy Weir could deliver, *Project Hail Mary* is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival to rival *The Martian* —while taking us to places it never dreamed of going.
**Amazon.com Review**
**An Amazon Best Book of May 2021:** As Ryland Grace awakens from a coma, he doesn’t know who he is or where he is, but a mix of calculations, deductions, and slowly returning memories enlightens him: He’s a junior high school science teacher on a small space ship. His mission? Save Earth. As in *The Martian* , Weir makes science and problem solving not only cool but absolutely essential to survival, delivering an electrifying space adventure that yanks at both the gut and the heart strings. Readers will absorb facts about gravity and heavy metals even as Grace races against the clock and builds an unexpected partnership while hurtling through the cold depths of space. *—Adrian Liang, Amazon Book Review*
### **Review**
“A propulsive adventure.” **—** Entertainment Weekly  
  
“Weir spins a space yarn in a way only he can. Fans of his earlier works won’t be disappointed.” **—** Newsweek  
  
“Andy Weir proves once again that he is a singular talent. *Project Hail Mary* is so fascinating and propulsive that it’s downright addictive. From the first page as Ryland wakes up not knowing who or where he is, I was hooked.” **—Taylor Jenkins Reid,** New York Times **bestselling author of** Daisy Jones & The Six **  
  
“Reading *Project Hail Mary* is like going on a field trip to outer space with the best science teacher you’ve ever had—and your class assignment is to save the world. This is one of the most original, compelling, and fun voyages I’ve ever taken.” **—Ernest Cline, #1** New York Times **bestselling author of** Ready Player One  
  
“Two worlds in peril, a competent (but flawed and human) man, a competent alien, unending scientific puzzles to unravel, with humanity itself at risk, this one has everything fans of old school SF (like me) love. If you like a lot of science in your science fiction, Andy Weir is the writer for you.” **—George R. R. Martin,** New York Times **bestselling author of** A Game of Thrones  
  
“I loved *The Martian,* but I actually find *Project Hail Mary* to be Mr. Weir’s finest work to date. It’s somehow both exciting, yet also personal. I’m constantly amazed by how well Mr. Weir continues to write wonderfully accessible science fiction without compromising either the science or the fiction.” **—Brandon Sanderson,** New York Times **bestselling author of the Stormlight Archive series**  
  
“Brilliantly funny and enjoyable . . . one of the most plausible science fiction books I’ve ever read.” **—Tim Peake, ESA astronaut and internationally bestselling author of** Limitless  
  
“Thrilling doesn’t even begin to describe *Project Hail Mary* , which is undisputedly the best book I’ve read in a very, very long time . . . I cheered, I laughed (a lot), I cried, and when the twist arrived and the book revealed its true target, my jaw hit the floor. Mark my words: *Project Hail Mary* is destined to become a classic.” **—Blake Crouch,** New York Times **bestselling author of  
** Recursion **and** Dark Matter  
  
“A joy to read . . . with *Project Hail Mary,* Weir is leaning hard into all that made *The Martian* kick.” **—** Locus  
  
“Readers may find themselves consuming this emotionally intense and thematically profound novel in one stay-up-all-night-until-your-eyes-bleed sitting. An unforgettable story of survival and the power of friendship—nothing short of a science fiction masterwork.”—Kirkus Reviews **(starred review)**
### **About the Author**
**Andy Weir** built a two-decade career as a software engineer until the success of his first published novel, *The Martian,* allowed him to live out his dream of writing full-time. He is a lifelong space nerd and a devoted hobbyist of such subjects as relativistic physics, orbital mechanics, and the history of manned spaceflight. He also mixes a mean cocktail. He lives in California.

"洛克菲勒","洛克菲勒","作者约翰·D·洛克菲勒 John D. Rockefeller（1839—1937年） 美国实业家、超级资本家，美孚石油公司（标准石油）创办人。出生于纽约州里奇福德镇，父亲威廉·埃弗里·洛克菲勒是一个无牌游医，母亲伊莱扎·戴维森是一个虔诚的浸理会教徒。由于其父缺乏责任心，长年在外以药贩身份流浪，导致家庭生活艰难。母亲伊莱扎肩负起养家糊口的繁重任务，独自抚养五个子女。幼年时，曾将自己捉到的小火鸡精心喂养，挑好的在集市上出售。12岁时积蓄了50美元，他把钱借给邻居，收取本息。          1855年，由于其父的原因不能继续上学，离7月16日高中毕业典礼只差两个月。约翰听从父亲建议，花了40块钱在福尔索姆商业学院克里夫兰分校读了一个为期三个月的课程。16岁的洛克菲勒在美国俄亥俄州的一家干货店当职员，每星期赚5美元。19岁，他下海经商，倒卖谷物和肉类。从这时起，洛克菲勒将每一笔收支记录在册，甚至不漏掉一个便士的慈善捐款。经过三年积累，22岁的洛克菲勒进入石油业，并于1870年创建标准石油公司。洛克菲勒成了蜚声海内外的“石油大王”。        1897年，从标准石油公司退休后，洛克菲勒专注于慈善事业。中国在洛克菲勒基金会的其海外投资中独占鳌头。众所周知的是，北京协和医院及医学院是洛克菲勒基金会在中国最大、最著名的一项事业；鲜为人知的是，周口店“北京人”的挖掘和考古工作，洛克菲勒基金会从一开始就参与其中。         对于中国人来说，“富不过3代”似乎是铁一样的定律，然而洛克菲勒家族从发迹至今已经绵延6代，仍未现颓废和没落的迹象。这与他们的财富观念和从小对子女的教育息息相关。他们的家族崇尚节俭并热衷创造财富。这两点从洛克菲勒家族的中兴之主劳伦斯·洛克菲勒的一生中体现得尤其充分。       2004年7月11日，坐拥亿万家财、在美国叱咤风云的劳伦斯·洛克菲勒在睡梦中与世长辞，享年94岁。这位洛克菲勒家族的第3代传人，尽管含着金钥匙出生，却绝不是一位纨绔子弟，他在有生之年不仅开了风险投资的先河，还为美国的环保及慈善事业作出了不朽的贡献。           老约翰·D·洛克菲勒惟一的儿子和继承人是小约翰·D·洛克菲勒。小约翰·D·洛克菲勒共有6个子女，姐姐芭布斯最大，其他都是男孩，从大到小分别是约翰、纳尔逊、劳伦斯、温斯罗普和大卫。劳伦斯·洛克菲勒1910年5月26日生于纽约。童年时期，劳伦斯与年长他两岁的纳尔逊关系最亲密，他们曾一同饲养兔子然后卖给科学实验室换取零用钱。这样的事情听起来似乎很难和富可敌国的洛克菲勒家族联系起来，但事实的确如此。         洛克菲勒家族的子孙之所以能获得日后非凡的成就，和他们自小受到的家庭教育有很大关系。为了避免孩子被家族的光环宠坏，不管是老约翰洛克菲勒还是小约翰洛克菲勒，在教子方面相当花心思，并有一套祖传教育计划。父亲鼓励劳伦斯等孩子做家务挣钱：逮到走廊上的苍蝇，每100只奖一角钱；捉住阁***楼上的耗子每只5分，背柴禾、劈柴禾也有价钱。劳伦斯和哥哥纳尔逊，分别在7岁和9岁时取得了擦全家皮鞋的特许权，每双皮鞋2分，长筒靴每双1角。          从约翰·D·洛克菲勒成为美国历史上的第一个10亿富翁到现在已经经历了一个多世纪的洛克菲勒家族，仍在续写着辉煌的历史，他们没有整天躲在房间里计划如何守住自己的财富，不让金钱落入别人口袋，而是积极的参与文化、卫生与慈善事业，怀着富有的负罪感将大量的资金用来建立各种基金，投资大学，医院，让整个社会分享他们的财富。在今天的美国，要完全躲避这个家族的影响几乎是不可能的，毫不夸张地说，洛克菲勒家族在过去150年的发展史就是整个美国历史的一个精确的缩影，并且已经成为美国国家精神的杰出代表。","/Users/zxy/Calibre Library/Luo Ke Fei Le/Luo Ke Fei Le Liu Gei Er Zi De 38Feng Xin (393)/cover.jpg","2021-12-27T23:30:24+08:00","mobi","","393","","zho","Calibre Library","2012-09-05T00:00:00+08:00","epub掌上书苑","","","1.0","516129","生活·励志","洛克菲勒留给儿子的38封信","洛克菲勒留给儿子的38封信","","f22f8c0d-cd21-4b0f-b61d-f33ad0b944e6"

"林达","林达","美国的面积和中国差不多。和大多数留学生及新移民一样，当我们一脚踏上这块广袤的陌生土地时，最初落脚点的选择是十分偶然的。我们落在了一个普通的地方，居住的环境平常而宁静。周围的美国人老老少少都在辛勤劳作，过着普通得不能再普通的生活。要想谋出一番好的光景，对他们也不是一件轻而易举的事情。　　还来不及作任何思索，新移民所面临的生活压力就立即把我们投入了同样的辛勤劳作之中。这样，我们和周围的普通美国人之间，自然就有了共同谋生而产生的共同语言，也有了共同的经历，共同的喜怒哀乐。不少美国人还成了我们的好朋友。我们无形中发现，美国已经渐渐地从一堆抽象的概念中走出来，变成了脚下实实在在的土地，变成了一片片森林牧场，变成了一个一个美国人。　　我们也有过被称之为“边缘人”的苦闷。我们显然不可能在进入这一块国土的同时，就在一瞬间也进入它的文化，而原来的文化背景又由于天长地远而渐显陌生。在实际生活中，两种截然不同的文化，会经常骤然直率地在我们面前相遇碰撞，一开始真有无所适从亦无可躲避的窘迫。然而，时间长了，我们开始对“边缘人”的处境逐渐坦然，甚至悟出了些什么。冷静下来，我们发现自己第一次能够这样坐在一个安静的地方，同时和两个文化保持一个不远也不近的距离，它们不仅开始有可能化为一片风景，而且第一次向我们呈现出前所未有的意义......","/Users/zxy/Calibre Library/Lin Da/Jin Ju Li Kan Mei Guo Xi Lie Quan Ji (422)/cover.jpg","2021-12-27T23:43:25+08:00","epub","","422","","zho","Calibre Library","2011-03-29T00:00:00+08:00","epub掌上书苑","","","1.0","1274965","","近距离看美国系列全集","近距离看美国系列全集","","c41884af-a7f6-44c8-9ccc-59a7a9f61fab"

"王朔","王朔","王朔在作者们这个时代是孤独的，是他在最正确的方向上坚持了中国文学的现实主义传统，直面人生的精神。大多数的人被他表面上的游戏味、痞子腔所蒙蔽，没有看到他在骨子里其实是一个真正的启蒙主义者，对他的小说里流露出来的深切的人道主义精神、对小人物的悲悯情怀、对爱情的渴望、对个体的人的存在价值渴求视而不见。 这几本书都是十年前或更早的时候写的，那时作者很自以为是，相信很多东西，不相信很多，欲望很强，以为已知的就是一切了。这些书里的人、情景和一些谈话是那时作者经历过的，在生活中也不特别，仅仅因为作者不知道更多的东西，才认为有趣，虚张声势地写下来。这些情景不在了，这些人也散了，活着的也未老先衰，作者也不再那么说话和如此看待自己，所以有时作者觉得自己失去了继续写作的能力。 年轻的时候认为有很多重要的在前面，只要不停地奔走就能看到，走过来了发现重要的都在身后发生了，已经过去了，再往前又是一片空白。对过去，没有什么可遗憾的，也没有任何偶然，都是必须经过的，作者不信一个人可以有两个以上的选择。","/Users/zxy/Calibre Library/Wang Shuo/Wang Shuo Wen Ji (Dian Cang Ban ) (475)/cover.jpg","2021-12-27T23:43:29+08:00","epub","","475","","zho","Calibre Library","2011-02-20T00:00:00+08:00","epub掌上书苑","","","1.0","3014607","现代·当代","王朔文集（典藏版）","王朔文集（典藏版）","","5d89fdf8-4dd6-4d3e-b28b-07303b6a8bbe"

"吴承恩","吴承恩","《西游记》为明代小说家吴承恩所著。取材于《大唐西域记》和民间传说、元杂剧。宋代《大唐三藏取经诗话》（本名《大唐三藏取经记》）是西游记故事见于说话文字的最早雏形，其中，唐僧就是以玄奘法师为原型的。
作为中国古代第一部浪漫主义长篇神魔小说，该书深刻地描绘了当时的社会现实，是魔幻现实主义的开创作品。先写了孙悟空出世，然后遇见了唐僧、猪八戒和沙和尚三人，但还是主要描写了孙悟空、猪八戒、沙和尚三人保护唐僧西行取经，唐僧从投胎到取经受了九九八十一难，一路降妖伏魔，九九归一，终于到达西天见到如来佛祖，最终五圣成真。
自《西游记》问世以来在民间广为流传，各式各样的版本层出不穷，明代刊本有六种，清代刊本、抄本也有七种，典籍所记已佚版本十三种。鸦片战争以后，中国古典文学作品大量被译为西文，西渐欧美，已有英、法、德、意、西、手语、世（世界语）、俄、捷、罗、波、日、朝、越等文种。并发表了不少研究论文和专著，对这部小说作出了极高的评价。被尊为中国古典四大名著之一。

"Bryson Payne","Bryson Payne","*Go H*ck Yourself* is an eye-opening, hands-on introduction to the world of hacking, from an award-winning cybersecurity coach. As you perform common attacks against yourself, you’ll be shocked by how easy they are to carry out—and realize just how vulnerable most people really are.
You’ll be guided through setting up a virtual hacking lab so you can safely try out attacks without putting yourself or others at risk. Then step-by-step instructions will walk you through executing every major type of attack, including physical access hacks, Google hacking and reconnaissance, social engineering and phishing, malware, password cracking, web hacking, and phone hacking. You’ll even hack a virtual car! You’ll experience each hack from the point of view of both the attacker and the target. Most importantly, every hack is grounded in real-life examples and paired with practical cyber defense tips, so you’ll understand how to guard against the hacks you perform.
You’ll learn:
•How to practice hacking within a safe, virtual environment  
•How to use popular hacking tools the way real hackers do, like Kali Linux, Metasploit, and John the Ripper  
•How to infect devices with malware, steal and crack passwords, phish for sensitive information, and more  
•How to use hacking skills for good, such as to access files on an old laptop when you can’t remember the password  
•Valuable strategies for protecting yourself from cyber attacks
You can’t truly understand cyber threats or defend against them until you’ve experienced them firsthand. By hacking yourself before the bad guys do, you’ll gain the knowledge you need to keep you and your loved ones safe.

"Carnegie, Dale","Dale Carnegie","EDITORIAL REVIEW:
*How to Win Friends and Influence People* is the first, and still the finest, book of its kind. One of the best-known motivational books in history, Dale Carnegie's groundbreaking work has sold millions of copies, has been translated into almost every known written language, and has helped countless people succeed in both their business and personal lives. 
First published in 1937, Carnegie's advice has remained relevant for generations because he addresses timeless questions about the fine art of getting along with people: How can you make people like you instantly? How can you persuade people to agree with you? How can you speak frankly to people without giving offense? The ability to read others and successfully navigate any social situation is critically important to those who want to get a job, keep a job, or simply expand their social network. 
The core principles of this book, originally written as a practical, working handbook on human relations, are proven effective. Carnegie explains the fundamentals of handling people with a positive approach; how to make people like you and want to help you; how to win people to your way of thinking without conflict; and how to be the kind of leader who inspires quality work, increased productivity, and high morale. 
As Carnegie explains, the majority of our success in life depends on our ability to communicate and manage personal relationships effectively, whether at home or at work. *How to Win Friends and Influence People* will help you discover and develop the people skills you need to live well and prosper.

"Moran, Caitlin","Caitlin Moran","1913 -- Suffragette throws herself under the King's horse. 1969 -- Feminists storm Miss World. NOW -- Caitlin Moran rewrites The Female Eunuch from a bar stool and demands to know why pants are getting smaller. There's never been a better time to be a woman: we have the vote and the Pill, and we haven't been burnt as witches since 1727. However, a few nagging questions do remain... Why are we supposed to get Brazilians? Should you get Botox? Do men secretly hate us? What should you call your vagina? Why does your bra hurt? And why does everyone ask you when you're going to have a baby? Part memoir, part rant, Caitlin Moran answers these questions and more in How To Be A Woman -- following her from her terrible 13th birthday ('I am 13 stone, have no friends, and boys throw gravel at me when they see me') through adolescence, the workplace, strip-clubs, love, fat, abortion, TopShop, motherhood and beyond.

"刘慈欣","刘慈欣","三体三部曲 (《三体》《三体Ⅱ·黑暗森林》《三体Ⅲ·死神永生》) ，原名“地球往事三部曲”，是中国著名科幻作家刘慈欣的首个长篇系列，由科幻世界杂志社策划制作，重庆出版集团出版。小说讲述了文革期间一次偶然的星际通讯引发的三体世界对地球的入侵以及之后人类文明与三体文明三百多年的恩怨情仇。三体三部曲出版后十分畅销，并深受读者和主流媒体好评，被普遍认为是中国科幻文学的里程碑之作，为中国科幻确立了一个新高度。《三体》文化大革命如火如荼进行的同时。军方探寻外星文明的绝秘计划“红岸工程”取得了突破性进展。但在按下发射键的那一刻，历经劫难的叶文洁没有意识到，她彻底改变了人类的命运。地球文明向宇宙发出的第一声啼鸣，以太阳为中心，以光速向宇宙深处飞驰……四光年外，“三体文明”正苦苦挣扎——三颗无规则运行的太阳主导下的百余次毁灭与重生逼迫他们逃离母星。而恰在此时。他们接收到了地球发来的信息。在运用超技术锁死地球人的基础科学之后。三体人庞大的宇宙舰队开始向地球进发……人类的末日悄然来临。《三体Ⅱ·黑暗森林》三体人在利用魔法般的科技锁死了地球人的科学之后，庞大的宇宙舰队杀气腾腾地直扑太阳系，意欲清除地球文明。面对前所未有的危局，经历过无数磨难的地球人组建起同样庞大的太空舰队，同时，利用三体人思维透明的致命缺陷，制订了神秘莫测的“面壁计划”，精选出四位“面壁者”。秘密展开对三体人的反击。三体人自身虽然无法识破人类的诡谲计谋，却依靠由地球人中的背叛者挑选出的“破壁人”，与“面壁者”展开智慧博弈……“面壁计划”究竟能否成功？地球人究竟能否在这场你死我活的文明生存竞争中战而胜之？神秘的“黑暗森林”究竟意味着什么？《三体Ⅲ·死神永生》与三体文明的战争使人类第一次看到了宇宙黑暗的真相，地球文明像一个恐惧的孩子，熄灭了寻友的篝火，在暗夜中发抖。自以为历经沧桑，其实刚刚蹒跚学步；自以为悟出了生存竞争的秘密，其实还远没有竞争的资格。使两个文明命悬一线的黑暗森林打击，不过是宇宙战场上一个微不足道的插曲。真正的星际战争没人见过，也不可能见到，因为战争的方式和武器已经远远超出人类的想象，目睹战场之日，即是灭亡之时。宇宙的田园时代已经远去，昙花一现的终极之美最终变成任何智慧体都无法做出的梦，变成游吟诗人缥缈的残歌；宇宙的物竞天择已到了最惨烈的时刻，在亿万光年暗无天日的战场上，深渊最底层的毁灭力量被唤醒，太空变成了死神广阔的披风。太阳系中的人们永远不会知道这一切，最后直面真相的，只有两双眼睛。

"纳西姆·尼古拉斯·塔勒布","纳西姆·尼古拉斯·塔勒布","为什么这个世界上最稳定的国家其实没有政府？  
为什么负债对你不好，以及为什么我们通常所说的“效率”根本缺乏就是效率？  
为什么政府和社会政策保护强者，却伤害弱者？  
为什么你应该在还没入职之前，就应该写好辞职信？  
泰坦尼克号的沉没为什么拯救了更多的生命？  
尼采有句名言：“杀不死我的，使我更强大。”就像人的骨头承受压力和紧张会变得更加强壮，谣言或暴乱在有人试图压制它们时会变本加厉一样，生命中的许多事物也会受益于压力、混乱、波动和不确定。  
畅销书《黑天鹅》告诉我们，发生概率极低的事件和无法预测的“黑天鹅”事件，在世界上几乎每一种事物的身上都会发生。在《反脆弱》一书中，塔勒布告诉我们在不确定的世界中的生存法则，他找到并定义了“反脆弱”类事物：每一个事物都会从波动中得到利益或蒙受损失，脆弱性是指因为波动和不确定而承受损失，反脆弱性则是指让自己避免这些损失，甚至从混乱和不确定中获利。  
反脆弱类事物不只受益于混沌，也需要适时出现的压力与危机，如此才能维持生存与实现繁荣。作者还认为，不确定性是件好事，甚至有其存在的必要，并且建议我们培养反脆弱性的特质。反脆弱性超越强韧性或坚固性：强韧性只能够抵抗震动和维持原状；反脆弱性则会让事物变得越来越好。此外，反脆弱性还可以避免预测误差，并且保护事物不受负面“黑天鹅”事件的影响。  
这本书大谈试错法、人生的大小决定、政治、自治市、战争、个人理财、经济体系和医疗系统……风格独树一帜。《反脆弱》性是我们生活在不确定世界中的“导航仪”，也是面对随时可能出现的“黑天鹅”事件的终极自保指南。

Everyone wants to be their friend (or, if single, their lover!) In business, they rise swiftly to the top of the corporate ladder. What is their ""Midas touch?"" What it boils down to is a more skillful way of dealing with people. The author has spent her career teaching people how to communicate for success. In her book How to Talk to Anyone (Contemporary Books, October 2003) Lowndes offers 92 easy and effective sure-fire success techniques-- she takes the reader from first meeting all the way up to sophisticated techniques used by the big winners in life. In this information-packed book you’ll find:9 ways to make a dynamite first impression 14 ways to master small talk, ""big talk,"" and body language14 ways to walk and talk like a VIP or celebrity6 ways to sound like an insider in any crowd7 ways to establish deep subliminal rapport with anyone9 ways to feed someone's ego (and know when NOT to!) 11 ways to make your phone a powerful communications tool15 ways to work a party like a politician works a room 7 ways to talk with tigers and not get eaten alive In her trademark entertaining and straight-shooting style, Leil gives the techniques catchy names so you'll remember them when you really need them, including: ""Rubberneck the Room,"" ""Be a Copyclass,"" ""Come Hither Hands,"" “Bare Their Hot Button,” “The Great Scorecard in the Sky,"" and ""Play the Tombstone Game,” for big success in your social life, romance, and business.How to Talk to Anyone, which is an update of her popular book, Talking the Winner's Way (see the 5-star reviews of the latter)is based on solid research about techniques that work!By the way, don't confuse How to Talk to Anyone with one of Leil's previous books, How to Talk to Anybody About Anything. This one is completely different!","/Users/zxy/Calibre Library/Leil Lowndes/How to Talk to Anyone (881)/cover.jpg","2023-04-03T11:56:33+08:00","epub","9780071418584","881","isbn:9780071418584","","Calibre Library","2003-09-20T01:25:11+08:00","McGraw Hill Professional","4","","1.0","239453","Language Arts & Disciplines, General, Family & Relationships, Psychology, Self-Help, Personal Growth, Interpersonal relations, Business, Economics, Business & Economics, Social Psychology, Personal Growth - General, Careers & Success, working, Interpersonal communication, Communication, Body language., Oral Communication In Business, Business Communication, Business Communication - General, Interpersonal communication., Advice on careers & achieving success, Electronic books, Body language, Social Interaction","How to Talk to Anyone","How to Talk to Anyone","False","f2222256-82a7-45cc-a3b2-0c3f90b24fd8"

"武志红","武志红","知名心理学家武志红迄今最重要作品 ‖ 作者思索21年、书写5年，系统透视中国国民性  
“我们90%的爱与痛，都和一个基本事实有关——大多数成年人，心理水平是婴儿，这样的成年人是巨婴，这样的国家，是巨婴国。 ”  
_________
1995年，作者在北大读心理学大二时立下心愿： 一定要搞明白，人到底是怎么回事！  
自此，踏上了探索之路。
21年过去了，学生时代发出的 大哉问逐渐有了清晰的答案。
作者发现，我们90%的爱与痛，都和一个基本事实有关——大多数成年人，心理水平是婴儿。这样的成年人，是巨婴，而这样的国家，是巨婴国。以“巨婴”和“巨婴国”的概念再来解读当下的人心、国民性及社会，问题变得清晰可见。
在本书中，作者透彻地呈现和分析了巨婴的全能自恋心理，而此心理即集体主义和愚孝的深层心理机制，这样的心理机制下，催生了中国好人、控制狂、被迫害妄想、无助感、不安全感、躁狂抑郁等一系列当下普遍存在的心理问题。
作者说，我们发展了很复杂的行为，对权力、名声、成就与物质等的需求可以涨到很高的地步，但它们常常是一种防御，是两种在婴儿时期没被满足的最原始的简单愿望转化出来的。一个愿望是：抱抱我；一个愿望是：看着我。
本书以显微镜式的微细与精确呈现出了人性心理的角角落落，而作者优美的文笔、对痛苦的敏感及深深的关怀，又令本书散发出温暖的人性之光。作者用最大声来鼓励每个人看到自己内在的负面能量，活在流动之中，拥抱内心的婴儿，从而活出丰盛的自己。  
__________
  
曾奇峰-心理学家
  
志红文章最突出的特点，是满足一个人对自己现实处境的哲学上的探究癖：我为什么是现在这个样子，以及随后立即浮现出来的问题：我怎样才可以不是这个样子。这个特点，来自志红深厚的精神分析或许说心理动力学基础。  
罗振宇-""罗辑思维""创始人
武志红厉害，看到了躲在我们成人躯壳下的婴儿。在武志红看来，我们对权力、名声、成就与物质等的高涨需求常常是一种防御，背后的声音是：抱抱我，看着我。这是非常深刻的观察与洞见。我向""罗辑思维""的所有读者推荐《巨婴国》。  
张德芬-身心灵作家
巨婴国真的是武志红老师呕心沥血的巨著，他引经据典又随手拈来许多自己经历过的小故事和对人性的洞察，我十分赞同他的观点。让我们这些巨婴都长大，那么这个社会、这个世界都会更加的美好！  
高铭-《天才在左 疯子在右》作者
巨婴，这个定义非常好。之前我曾经想过类似的问题但一直没找到准确的词汇来做个定义，而武志红先生做到了，且精准。

The Xeelee Sequence is a series of novels and short stories which span several billions of years, describing the future expansion of Mankind, its war with its arch-nemesis (an alien race called the Xeelee), and the Xeelee's own war with dark matter entities called photino birds.  
  
Beginning with RAFT in 1991, Stephen Baxter's epic sequence of Xeelee novels introduced readers to perhaps the most ambitious fictitious universe ever created.  
  
Beginning with the rise and fall of sub-quantum civilisations in the first nano-seconds after the Big Bang and ending with the heat death of the universe billions of years from now the series charts the story of mankind's epic war against the ancient and unknowable alien race the Xeelee.  
  
Along the way it examines questions of physics, the nature of reality, the evolution of mankind and its possible future. It looks not just at the morality of war but at the morality of survival and our place in the universe.  
  
This is a landmark in SF. And now, for the first time, all ten titles comprising the Xeelee sequence are collected together in one volume.  
  
Includes: Raft, Timelike Infinity, Flux, Ring, Coalescent, Exultant, Transcendent, Resplendent, Vacuum Diagrams, Xeelee: Endurance
